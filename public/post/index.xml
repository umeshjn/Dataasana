      <description>Maps are wonderful visualization type for showing representing the geograhical information. I think after the bar plots, maps are the most commonly used and easily understood visualization type.
Highcharter R package provides us with very easy way of creating amazing maps. In this post we are going to learn how to create maps using this wonderful package.
Maps are used for plotting geographical data which provides more insights than using plain simple barplots or other visualizations.</description>

For example:Buying price and current price of different stocks in the portfolio.
We are going to use the below mentioned dataset for plotting the grouped bar chart.</description>
